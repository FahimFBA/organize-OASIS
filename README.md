## Introduction
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a project aimed at making neuroimaging data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community that contains the data of subjects with Nondemented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia. The dataset is organized into different directories. This repository contains all the scripts that were used to modify the OASIS-1 given `.xlsx` file and the entire dataset.

## Original Dataset Distribution

We have used the OASIS-1 dataset from [OASIS](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/). This is a free dataset, and publicly available to [download](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/).

The dataset comes with 12 `.tar.gz` files. Each of the
compressed files is around 1.5 gigabytes in size. We have also used the xlsx
file from OASIS-1 with Demographic, and Clinical Data. All of these are
publicly available on OASIS.
